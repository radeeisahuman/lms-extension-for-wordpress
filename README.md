# Free LMS System for Woocommerce

This project is to provide an LMS to a wordpress website without relying on plugins like Tutor LMS. The idea is to improve the performance of the site and saving of memory through the use of a lightweight solution. I want to make the actual courses encoded and not store them in memory. I have some ideas. Base64 encoding and store in the database paired with hashing for effective fetching of data.

First step is connect the site with the wordpress database. Simple enough. Then add code to the woocommerce website so that upon orders we send a post request. Process the post request to enroll the learner in the course. If I want to take it one step further I could just send a request to the wordpress website so that it can confirm the order and maybe send some kind of notification to the learner.
